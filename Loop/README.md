# Loop App Architecture

This document outlines the organized file structure of the Loop app, following Apple's best practices and iOS development conventions.

## Directory Structure

```
Loop/
├── LoopApp.swift                    # App entry point
├── Models/                          # Global data models
│   └── Chat.swift
├── Views/                           # Main app views
│   └── ContentView.swift
├── Features/                        # Feature-based organization
│   └── Chats/                       # Chat feature module
│       ├── Models/
│       │   └── Chat.swift           # Chat-specific models
│       ├── ViewModels/
│       │   └── ChatsListViewModel.swift
│       ├── Views/
│       │   ├── ChatsListView.swift
│       │   └── ConversationView.swift
│       └── Navigation/
│           └── ChatsRoute.swift
├── Shared/                          # Reusable components
│   ├── Components/
│   │   └── ChatRowView.swift
│   ├── Extensions/
│   │   └── View+Extensions.swift
│   └── Utilities/
│       └── Constants.swift
├── Resources/                       # App configuration
│   └── AppInfo.swift
└── Assets.xcassets/                 # App assets
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Feature-Based Organization
- Each major feature (like Chats) has its own directory
- Features are self-contained with their own Models, ViewModels, Views, and Navigation
- This makes the app scalable and maintainable as features grow

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management (MVVM pattern)
- **Views**: UI components and SwiftUI views
- **Navigation**: Routing and navigation logic

### 3. Shared Components
- Reusable UI components in `Shared/Components/`
- Common extensions in `Shared/Extensions/`
- App-wide constants and utilities in `Shared/Utilities/`

### 4. Resources
- App configuration and metadata in `Resources/`
- Assets remain in `Assets.xcassets/`

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without cluttering the root directory
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes it easy to find and modify code
3. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different features independently
4. **Testing**: Each feature can be tested in isolation
5. **Reusability**: Shared components reduce code duplication

## Future Considerations

As the app grows, consider adding:
- `Services/` directory for API calls and data services
- `Core/` directory for core app functionality
- `Tests/` directory for unit and UI tests
- `Supporting Files/` for configuration files like Info.plist
